Nearly 3 in 4 active adults prefer working out at home, all the more so post-pandemic. Home-based workouts offer the convenience of exercising on one's own schedule, the flexibility to tailor workouts to their preferences, and the privacy and comfort of exercising at homes. However, due to the lack of expert guidance and supervision, there is an increased possibility of performing exercises incorrectly which may lead to strain, sprains, or other injuries.

WorkoutRight is designed specifically keeping injuries in mind; it is a web based tool to track exercises with real time feedback on posture maintenance. All you need is a laptop/PC with a webcam, and you can trust us to provide you with an efficient, safe workout with proper form.
